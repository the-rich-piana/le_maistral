## ABSTRACT

The advance of technology has seen increase in applications that integrate new kinds of information, such as multimedia data. The semantic information integration of heterogeneous data being created and stored is exponentially increasing and collectively called “Datospace”. Data being generated from various heterogeneous sources like, digital images, audio, video, web documents, e-books, e-magazines, e-newspapers, e-journal, e-knowledge, e-articles, e-science data, e-news, e-grids, e-stock, etc. for different domains including retail, medical, healthcare, energy, and day to day life activities. Information Retrieval from heterogeneous information systems is required but challenging as data are integrated in different forms. Data integration from different information systems, information integrated from heterogeneous data sources into single data source are faced major challenge of information transformation were in different formats and content in data transformation are required for using it for the development of integrating information systems, at the same is not cost effective.

Information retrieval from heterogeneous data sources remains a challenging base, as the number of data sources increases more intelligent retrieval techniques, focusing on information content and semantics, are required.

This paper describes the idea of information retrieval system, information integration which can be used in the Datospace and heterogeneous data problems over the web.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Information Retrieval Introduction

Research data such as information about research results, projects, publications, organizations, researchers published on the web are more and more pervasive in modern times. High volume of information is generated and published in research systems. Achieved research results produce requirements for research to have ability to retrieve research information in efficient way. Information overload, exponential size of amount of available information, and growth in the heterogeneous and distributed nature of information. To solve these problems a number of Current Research Information Systems (CRIS) is being developed.

But in most cases such system do not solve task of providing to researcher complete and actual information with minimum information noise. Researchers are not prone to publish results about their research in information systems, publishing results in one information systems, and not in others. For example, if a researcher provides actual and complete information for increased persons, information from research pages also should be included into information retrieval operations. Usually researchers or policy makers demands for research information is not limited to only information stored in any single systems. Research information in any science or technology domain is integrated into single database or instance of heterogeneous information systems.

There is a strong need to gather information according respect when it possible to point research to systems where information can be found. It is very important to know if the gathered research information is actual and complete. So, a research information system should be able to provide information from any source, which will be 1) easy to implement for any researcher, 2) flexible enough to embrace diversity and data mining and structure in different organizations, sectors of science and states. 2) powerful to go provide sophisticated information retrieval system to researchers. CRIS development is in provide access to research data which are scattered on the web, pages, stored in different research information systems. The informational needs of a researcher or potential user are very seldom limited to information from one data source, and they want to access information from a wide range of region or sector of science. There is a strong need to integrate information from different sources and to provide access to all information to users, enabling them to utilize a wider range of data, to avoid the “silos” problem. Such development is required to achieve heterogeneity of research information.

One of the main problems to deal with information managing is the weak interoperability between various databases and information systems. Especially this problem is serious when we want to organize collaboration between the information systems of various departments within the organization. Data integration is the most important topic during the last years. For instance, there are such data sources as employee data source, student data source, library data source etc. within the same enterprise (talking of academic institutions). When someone wants to piece of information from one data source he or she should provide user with a such results, retrieved from it. Data sources are sourced based on user criteria and result of information sources is integrated into single warehouse, this is a complex task. Data source are not static, and the structure of this source is variable and is defined a fresh every time.

### 1.2 Datospace Introduction

Designing Datospace support platforms builds on the traditional strengths our field and will involve significant extensions of data management techniques, but it will be crucial as leverage techniques from several other fields. He knowledge representation and the Semantic Web offer two main benefits as we try to make sense of heterogeneous collections of data in a Datospace: simple but useful formalisms for representing ontology’s, and the concept of

URI (uniform resource identifier) as a mechanism for referring to digital constants on which there exists some agreement among multiple data providers. Similarly, as discussed earlier, several operations on Dataspace inherently involve some degree of uncertainty about the data, its lineage, its metadata and so on.

The Uncertainty in AI Community has developed several formalisms for modelling uncertainty, but these tend to be very expressive. The challenge is to find models that are useful yet simple, understandable, and scalable. Naturally, much of the data in a Dataspace will be unstructured text. Hence, it is important that techniques for Information Retrieval will play a central role in building a Dataspace. The problem is that the typical end user from Information Visualization will be valuable here: Providing an effective mechanism for personal information retrieval is important for many applications, and requires different techniques from those been developed for general purpose search engines. This means developing models, and representations for personal search, and on designing evaluation frameworks that can be used to demonstrate retrieval effectiveness in a personal environment. From the retrieval model perspective, personal information retrieval represents a more complex, unstructured, unsupervised, and often noisy environment. Based on this perspective, we propose a retrieval model that exploits document metadata and multi-type structure. Proposed retrieval models were evaluated using a benchmark dataset, a standard document collection, such as novice and job description.

The paper is organized as follows: Section II Represents the basic of Information Retrieval System requirement with IR techniques, Section III Explains the Dataspace, Section IV Shows Heterogeneity of Data Sources and data integration and describes results already achieved in this area. Section IV Shows Heterogeneity of Data Sources and data integration and describes results already achieved in this area. Section V Discusses the challenges and issues of Information Retrieval with their challenges, and Final Section VI Concludes and future of the paper.

## 2. INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM

Information retrieval is the art of demonstration, storage, organization of and access to information items. The representation and organization of information should be in such a way that the end user can access information to meet his/her information need. The objective of information retrieval system is to provide a retrieval finds the structured, semi-structured or unstructured data that satisfies information need from within the Dataspace, and it is information the end user on the existence and whereabouts of data relating to his or her query.

### 2.1 Components of IR System

In this section we describe the components of a basic web information retrieval system shown in Fig.1. A general information retrieval system has four components: 1) Collection: A collection of documents that includes Crawling. The system browses the document collection and fetches documents. 2), Indexing: The system builds an index of the documents. 3), User gives the query. 4), Ranking: The system retrieves documents that are relevant to the query from the collection and sorts them in order of relevance. Social media like Facebook, User may give relevance feedback to the search engine. Information Retrieval Component for Dataspace responsible for Querying and Searching the system should support (1). Transition between keyword querying, browsing and structured querying. 2) Meta-data queries. 3) Queries about the source of the data. 4). Filtering and aggregation, also called monitoring of the Dataspace.

### 2.2 Why Information Retrieval

Overwhelmed by Flood of Information over the planet is a major problem faced by decision makers. Because of the sheer heterogeneity of data, are used different sets of mechanisms to retrieve the information over the web. According to www.worldwidewebsize.com (Thursday, 08 January, 2015): there are more than 11134 million pages on the Web. Google’s has counted 137.8 billion pages. Dutch indexed Web contains at least 235.5 million pages. According to the www.factsabout.com (2013) there are (1) 759 Million - Total number of websites on the Web. (2) 510 Million - Total number of Live websites active. (5) 118 Trillion - Total number of emails sent in a year. (4) Trillion - WebPages. Live on the Internet. (5) 48 Billion - WebPages indexed by Google Inc. (6) 14 Billion - WebPages indexed by Microsoft Bing. (7) CIIII.com indexed more than 120 Billion live pages. (8) Major search engines indexed at least tens of billions of pages.

### 2.3 Information Retrieval Techniques

The goal of any information retrieval system is to satisfy user’s information need. Unfortunately, characterization of user’s information need is also complex and does not know clearly about the information need. On the other hand, the information retrieved and the representation of the information retrieved by the system is incomplete.
operations like query expansion, stop word removal etc. are usually done on the query. In information retrieval, the criterion typically is the relevance of the retrieved information item with respect to the information need at hand. To achieve this goal, Information Retrieval Systems usually implement some form of preprocessing.

1) In preprocessing, the documents are represented in summarized content form. 2) In filtering process, all the stop words and common words are removed. 3) Searching is the core process of IRS. There are various techniques for retrieving documents that match with user need.

We have defined a retrieval technique [5] as a technique for comparing the query with the document representations, we can further classify retrieval techniques into binary, partial and ranked categories. We give a brief overview of the techniques among retrieval techniques. Fig. 3 gives a diagrammatic view of the classification.

The first distinction that we make among retrieval techniques is whether the set of retrieved documents contains only documents whose representation are an exact match with the query or a partial match with the query. For a partial match, it is possible to use only those that are an exact match with the query.

![Fig. 3: Information Retrieval Techniques](image_url)

The next level of the classification distinguish between techniques that compare the query with individual document representations and techniques that use a representation of documents that encompasses connections to other documents in the collection. The former can be seen as representing a direct match technique, but the retrieval is based on connections to other documents and not solely on the contents of an individual document. In the latter category, we identify the subcategories of cluster based search and searches based on browsing a network of documents.

The individual categories break down into retrieval techniques that have a feature-based representation of query and documents and a technique that use a structured based representation. In a feature based representation, queries and documents are represented as set of features, such as index items. Features can be weighted and can represent more complex entities in the text than single words. The structured based category is divided into representations based on logic, that is those in which the meaning of queries and documents is captured using a formal language, and graph based representations, in which documents and queries are represented by graph like structures composed of nodes and edges connecting these nodes. Such graphs can be produced using various techniques (e.g., semantics net and frame) or statistical techniques (e.g., latent semantic indexing).

The feature based category includes techniques based on format model (including the vector space model, probabilistic ranking model, fuzzy set model, and Boolean model) and the techniques based on ad hoc similarity measures.

## 3. DATASPACE

As the volumes of data storage increase within and across enterprises, there is a growing need to develop efficient and effective techniques of data management. With the increase in the volume of data and the increase in the real data available on the web, as well as large databases, the impact has been that new opportunities for using data integration technologies have been created. A general view of Dataspace is shown in the Fig.4. However, in spite of the benefits of using these technologies, many organizations and researchers have had a limited impact in practice.

To a large extent, data integration mechanisms are manually coded and tightly bound to specific applications. The limited adoption of data integration technology is partly due to its cost-ineffectiveness [1]. The problem of data integration has been investigated for a relatively long period of time spanning the last two decades. The introduction of data integration technologies has provided transparent access to data sets that reside in multiple data sources and are stored using heterogeneous representations. Data integration has numerous potential applications, e.g., it can be used for providing cross-querying of data stored in different data sources, or for integrating data from different data sources in the same organization, or to enhance collaboration in large scientific projects by providing investigators with a means for querying and combining results produced by multiple research labs [1].

More precisely, the specification of schemas mappings (in such a way that data structured under the source schemas is transformed into a format that is compatible with the target schema) is the most challenging aspect. Data integration is a complex task, both in terms of resource consuming, and has also been determined as a critical bottleneck to the large scale deployment of data integration systems [2]. Dataspace as a new concept has been introduced in 2005. Dataspace has gradually been treated as the key technique of data integration [3, 11]. Data integration is an important research topic since it aims at providing transparent access to data that is stored in various data repositories that are often using different underlying data models.

### 3.1 Why Dataspace?

Dataspace are clearly distinguished from traditional data integration techniques for the following two main reasons: 1) Dataspace provides a means for integration on a pay-as-you-go fashion. This way it is cheaper. 2) More importantly, Dataspace do not require effort for semantic integration; they focus on data-existence instead.

Additionally, Dataspace provide higher degrees of scalability and have a perceived nature of the entity relationships [11, 13].

## Examples

One example of a Datamespace described as a personal Datamespace is described by [3] as a personal Datamespace in which users access data stored in a set of personal data repositories.

That set of repositories may include private file systems that currently exist on a user's desktop as well as private emails of a particular data user.

Fig. 4 A View of Datospace:






Examples:
One example of a Datospace described as a personal Datospace is described by [3] as a personal Datospace in which users access data stored in a set of personal data repositories.





Personal Datospace:
That set of repositories may include private file systems that currently exist on a user's desktop as well as private emails of a particular user. In the case of personal Datospace just like the corporate Datospace, users have the ability to understand which items spread across their repositories/sources are related to each other in the same context. Although users are likely to search their data sources for information, the information is not necessarily organized and therefore not enriched with contextual information. Users may typically need to access the various versions of a certain file that exist in their Datospace, view files as well as emails worked on approximately the same time, or extract emails in the same project of a certain discussion.





Corporate Datospace:






Public Datospace:
A second example of a Datospace which is available as a public Datospace is the Google Datospace. It is larger developed as a very large, well describing, semi-structured, heterogeneous database. Google Base certainly consists of a set of tuples with attribute values. Each tuple entry te is recorded in stored as a number of attributes with matching values. An illustration of a Datospace tuple is shown in Fig. 5.

T_e(name: GalaxyPrime), (Color: black), (name: Samsung), (tel: 8756), (addr: Plotro 8, Alwar, Raj.), (website: Samsung.com))

In this case, the tuple in the Datospace set can be considered is a tuple in an existing Datospace. In this second example, the information is coming from a Datastore of heterogeneous data, which are continuously contributed by users around the world.




4. HETEROGENEITY OF DATA SOURCES:

In addition to the decentralization, the effectiveness of information retrieval is further worsened by the variety of heterogeneity present in the data sources. In each of these sources, data is organized using a different system operating systems, SQL, Vector implementations etc., based on different conceptual models, and on different formats “system level heterogeneity” is considered in Behnoudja much easier than before (e.g. via ODBCTJBC connections for heterogeneous data exchange and integration) or the more general case of the so-called “semantic heterogeneity”, which appears every time there is a more than one way to structure a body of data. Semantic heterogeneity seems to be an unavoidable burden as data is increasingly becoming the primary asset of organizations. Semantic heterogeneity is due to the variety of data according to their own understanding of the reality. This of course is fundamentally different from one individual to another
. In that sense, heterogeneity is to be found in data models, conceptual schemas, and of course the mind of the user. Page Lyson [9].


4.1 Solution:

The basic principle of data integration is to combine different data sources into a single homogeneous Datastore in a way that a whole new data Source is generated. The end user, when querying for data, has the illusion of interacting with one single system, which presents him a unified logical view of the data available. The first attempt to address this problem was to create a global data source based primarily on data warehousing technologies. Traditional solutions preserve creation of new data sources on information integration from heterogeneous data sources, which is not cost effective.


5. INFORMATION RETRIEVAL IN DATASPACE:
Information retrieval (IR) is the task of representing, storing, organizing, and offering access to information items. IR is different from data retrieval, which is about finding precise information from a file or database. The information is not structured; it is the collection of heterogeneous data i.e. Data from any number of sources, targets, computers and users, may be stored in many different formats or databases. It can be classified into a model using IR techniques (e.g. Web documents, Email messages, RSS feeds, Audio files, Video files), semi-structured (e.g. XML, LATINX, web data, Electronic Data Interchange(EDI), scientific data), or unstructured text (e.g. blogs, email, web pages, news articles, and social media), relational data model, utility of real-world objects (e.g. Relational database (RDB), Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Enterprise Resource Planning(ERP) data, collectively called Datospace.
The basic question in Datospace information retrieval is that How to find data of interest in within a collection of heterogeneous data?

5.2 Information Retrieval models for Datospace:

The fundamental IR models can be classified into Boolean, vector, and probabilistic models [6, 7, 10]. These IR models are based on information representation. The most used data models in information retrieval are: the Vector Space Model(VSM), representing resources and queries as vectors in Datospace - the Probabilistic Ranking Model(PRP) using the notion resources pertinence with respect to a specific query, and the Inference Network defined as an hybrid of VSM and PRP models.

1) **Boolean model**: The Boolean model allows for the use of operators of Boolean algebra, AND, OR and NOT; for query formulation, but has one major disadvantage: a Boolean system is not able to rank the returned list of documents. In the Boolean model, a document is selected when it satisfies a query keyword. Otherwise, it is rejected by the operators AND, OR, or NOT/BUT. The retrieval function in this model treats a document as either relevant or irrelevant [7].

2) **Vector Space Model**: The vector space model can best be characterized by its attempt to rank documents by the similarity between the query and each document in the vector space. This model represents documents and queries as vectors. The numeric settings that document vectors are computed using the similarity cosine function. Similarity Cosine function can be defined as:

$$Sim(d_{i}, q) = \frac{d_{i} . q}{||d_{i}||||q||} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{M} w_{i,j} w_{t,j}}{ \sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^{M} w_{i,j}^{2}} \sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^{M} w_{t,j}^{2}}} $$

Documents and queries are represented as vectors.

$$d_{i} = (w_{i,1}, w_{i,2}, ..., w_{i,t})$$

$$q = (w_{t,1}, w_{t,2}, ..., w_{t,t})$$

Vector Space Model have been introduce term weight scheme known as tf-idf weighting. These weights have a term frequency (tf) factor measuring the frequency of occurrence of a term in the document and an inverse document frequency (idf) factor measuring the inverse of the number of documents that contain a query or document term [8].

3) **Probabilistic model**: The most important characteristic of the probabilistic model is its attempt to rank documents by their probability of relevance given a query. Documents and queries are represented in this model as a vector of term probabilities. A vector element indicating whether a document attribute or term occurs in the document or query, or not. Instead of probabilities, the probabilistic model uses odds (OR), where OR(A), P(R|A) = P(R|R), R means "document is relevant" and OR(A) — "document is not relevant" [8].

### 5.3 Information Retrieval challenges for Dataspace

There exists several information retrieval techniques, however, none of them is designed to operate on a Dataspace. The main challenge is to generate the documents of the Dataspace and determine the appropriate data contained in the data sources. Challenges faced by search engines, in Dataspace to retrieve the relevant data or information.

**Challenge 1:** One particular challenge is the huge scale, given by the huge number of WebPages available on the Internet (for example, about 30 billion WebPages were indexed by Google in 2005).

**Challenge 2:** Another challenge is inherent to any information retrieval system that deals with text: the ambiguity. In this particular case, the Ambiguity has other roots: if the services it interfaces with have perfect matches between documents and user queries.

**Challenge 3:** Downloading DSSP, will involve significant extensions of data management techniques, but it will be crucial to leverage techniques from several other fields.

**Challenge 4:** Several operations on Dataspace inherently involve some degree of overlap about the data, its lineage, correctness and completeness

**Challenge 5:** Incorporating techniques from Information Retrieval will play a crucial role in building DSSP.

**Challenge 6:** Recent techniques from Information Visualization will be valuable.

### 6. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE

Due to the inherent heterogeneity and scheme extraction can not be easy in Dataspace. Systems mine data sources of Relational Database management systems because exploration of domain knowledge is very crucial for CRIS systems. Data Integration techniques designed for heterogeneous data sources are early years of knowledge optimization. Users are not compromising with low standards of information accuracy and are willing to find the right information from the huge data available on the Web. Data mining has shown excellent progress in dealing with the most crucial problems presented on the way of integrating data, however, further challenges arise constantly.

The expansion of scm & unstructured data (XML) for example implies that data sources are even more complex and difficult to handle. Capturing with semantic heterogeneity in the data sources is a key challenge. Current semantic technologies are still not mature enough to be applied in practice. Users are not compromising with low standards of information accuracy and are willing to find the right information from the huge data available on the Web. Data mining has shown excellent progress in dealing with the most crucial problems presented on the way of integrating data, however, further challenges arise constantly.

There are several directions for future work in this area. It would be interesting to develop new approaches to integrate information retrieval model under this framework which can be used for in future research. We also need to extend the techniques to deal with the data semantics to do research in Information Retrieval and Dataspace challenges.

## ABSTRACT

The advance of technology has seen an increase in applications that integrate new kinds of information, such as multimedia data, large-scale data, and heterogeneous data. The challenge of integrating or heterogeneous data being crucially and stored is exponentially called “Datospace”. Data being generated from various heterogeneous sources like, digital images, audio, video, web services, etc., have made the integration more complex. These data sources, click streams for different domains including retail, medical, healthcare, energy, and day to day life attributes. Information Retrieval from heterogeneous information systems is required but challenging at the same time. As the data is coming from different sources and format, the information integrated from different information sources are faced with major challenges of information transformation were in different formats and contents. In data transformation are required for the information for the integration in heterogeneous information systems, at the same time it is not cost effective.

Information retrieval from heterogeneous data sources remains a challenging issue, as the number of data sources increases more intelligent retrieval techniques, focusing on information content and semantics, are required.

This paper describes the idea of information retrieval system. Information Integration which can be used in the Datospace and heterogeneous data problems over the web.

### 1. INTRODUCTION

#### 1.1 Information Retrieval Introduction

Research data such as information about research results, projects, publications, organizations, researchers published on the web have more and more pervasive role in modern life. High quality of research results is a key factor to achieving research results produce requirements for research to have ability to retrieve research information in different way. Information Overloading, exponential rate of amount of information on the web, and the increase in the available information. To solve these problems a number of Current Research Information Systems (CRIS) is being developed.

But in most cases such systems do not solve task of providing to researcher complete and actual information with minimum information noise. Researchers are not prone to publish results about their research in information systems, publishing results about their research in journal or conference proceedings. So, for the non-users of CRIS to get actual and complete information for increased persons, information from research pages also should be included into information retrieval operations. Usually researcher’s or policy makers’ demands for research information is not limited to only information stored in any single systems. Research information in any science or technology domain is dispersed among a number of heterogeneous information systems.

There is a strong need to gather information according request when it possible or to point researcher to systems where information can be found. It is very important to know if the gathered research information is actual and complete. So, a researcher needs to know where to go to find the required information which as well be 1) easy to implement for any organization, 2) improve the quality of the information retrieval, 3) provide different research information systems with a broad range of information, 4) provide easy access to research information, 5) provide access to information in any region or sector of science. There is a strong need to integrate information from different sources and to provide access to all information in theory, enabling them to utilize a wider range of information and to increase the impact of their research.

One of the main problems to deal with information managing is the weak interoperability between various databases and information systems. Especially this problem is serious when we want to organize collaboration between the information systems of various departments within the organization. Data management is one of the most important and challenging topic during the last years. For instance, there are such data sources as employee data source, student data source, library data source etc. within the same enterprise (taking of academic institution). When someone wants piece of information from one data source, he/she has to go to the data source separately. Heterogeneous data sources are scattered based on user criteria and result of n sources is integrated into single source, this system creates every time, which means single data source is dynamic, and not static, as each structure of this source is variable and is defined a fresh every time.

#### 1.2 Datospace Introduction

Describing Datospace support platforms builts on the traditional3 web architecture our field and will involve significant extensions of data management techniques, but it will be crucial as leverage technologies from several other fields. The Datospace concept is that it should provide knowledge representation (and the Semantic Web) offer two main benefits as we try to make sense of heterogeneous collections of data in a Datospace: simple, but useful formalisms for representing ontology’s and the concept of

URL uniform resource identifiers as a mechanism for refering to digital contents on which there exists some agreement among multiple data providers. Similarly, as discussed earlier, several operations on Datospace inherently involve some degree of uncertainty about the data, its lineage, and structured query.

The Uncertainty in AI Community had developed several formalisms for modeling uncertainty, but these tend to be very expressive. The challenge is to find models that are useful yet simple, understandable, and scalable. Naturally, much of the data in a Datospace will be unstructured text. Hence, information retrieval techniques for information retrieval will play a central role in building DSSP. In practice, however, users do not know exactly what they are looking for or how to interpret the results. Hence, it is important that tools be able to progressively visualize results of searches and provide a means for users to specify what they are looking for. We have found that techniques from Information Visualization will be valuable here. Providing an effective mechanism for personal information retrieval is important for many applications, and requires different techniques. For this reason, this paper develops models for the different types of personal information retrieval, including methods for representing user search, and on designing evaluation frameworks that can be used to demonstrate retrieval effectiveness in a personal environment. From the retrieval model perspective, personal information retrieval can be treated as a multi-type information search problem, where the goal is to retrieve relevant information for a given query. Based on this perspective, we propose a retrieval model that exploits document metadata and multi-type structure. Proposed retrieval models were evaluated on a set of benchmarks, and we observed document collections, such as movies and job descriptions.

The paper is organized as follows. Section II Represents the basic components of IR System requirement with IR techniques. Section III Explains the Datastore, Section IV Shows Heterogeneity of Data Sources and data integration and describes results already achieved in this area. Section IV Extends the discussion to the applications of IR Techniques with their challenges, and Final Section VI Concludes and future of the paper.

## 2. INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM

Information retrieval is the art of demonstration, storage, organization of and access to information items. The representation and organization of information should be in such a way that the end user can access information to meet the information need. Hence, the design of information system and information retrieval finds the structured, semi-structured or unstructured data but satisfies information need from within the Datastore, and it is information the end user on the existence and whereabouts of data relating to this or her query.

### 2.1 Components of IR System

In this section we describe the components of a basic web information retrieval system shown in Fig.1. A general Web Information Retrieval system consists of the following components: 1. Crawling: The system browses the document collection and fetches documents. 2. Indexing: The system builds an index of the documents. 3. User gives the query. 4. Ranking: The system retrieves documents that are relevant to the query from the collection. 5. Presentation: The system presents the results to the user. Information Retrieval Component for Datastore supports for Querying and Searching the system should support (1). Transition between keyword querying, browsing and structured query. 2) Meta-data queries. 3) Queries about the source of the data. 4) Filtering and aggregation, also called monitoring of the Datastore.

### 2.2 Why Information Retrieval

Overwhelmed by Flood of Information over the planet is flooding, the information is increasing every day. Internet users in the world are used different types of mechanisms to retrieve the information over the web. According to www.worldwidewebsize.com (Thursday, 08 January, 2015) there are more than 11.73 million pages on the Web, 500 new sites are added daily, 3.2 billion people are online, 2.7 billion e-mails are sent each day, 200 million photos are uploaded to Facebook daily, 100 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute, and 350 hours of video are viewed on YouTube every minute. According to www.bbc.co.uk (2013) the world's largest web index has more than 100 million pages. The index includes pages that are no longer available and pages that have been deleted. According to www.statista.com (2013) there are (1) 759 Million – Total number of websites on the Web. (2) 310 Million – Total number of Live websites. (3) 100 Million – Total number of Domains. (4) 10.7 Billion – Web Pages. (5) 48 Billion WebPages indexed by Google. Bing (4.6) 14 Billion - WebPages indexed by Microsoft's Bing. (7) CIIIL.com indexed more than 129 Billion live pages. (8) Major search engines indexed at least tens of billions of pages. 100.5 Billion WebPages indexed by Google. Bing (4.6) 14 Billion - WebPages indexed by Microsoft's Bing. (7) CIIIL.com indexed more than 129 Billion live pages. (8) Major search engines indexed at least tens of billions of pages.

### 2.3 Information Retrieval Techniques

The goal of any information retrieval system is to satisfy the user's information need. Unfortunately, characterization of information needs is not as simple as the user's other do not known what they are looking for.

operations like query expansion, stop word removal etc. are usually done on the query. In information retrieval, the criterion typically is the relevance of the retrieved information item with respect to the information need at hand. To achieve this goal, Information Retrieval Systems usually implement two main steps in the retrieval process:

1) In preprocessing the documents are re-represented in standardized content form. 2) In filtering process all the stop words and common words are removed. 3) Searching is the core process of IRS. There are various techniques for retrieving documents that match with user need.

We have defined a retrieval technique [5] as a technique for comparing the query with the document representations, we can further classify retrieval techniques in terms of the representations that are used. Some techniques do not fall naturally into only a single category in this classification and other are hybrids of techniques from different categories that can not be categorized in any one category. Fig. 3 gives a diagrammatic view of the classification.

The first distinction that we make among retrieval techniques is whether the set of retrieved documents contains only documents whose representation are an exact match with the query or a partial match with the query. For a partial match, the retrieval technique will include also those that are an exact match with the query.

![Fig. 3: Information Retrieval Techniques](https://example.com/fig3.png)

The next level of the classification distinguish between techniques that compare the query with individual document representations and techniques that use a representation of documents that encompasses connection to other documents in the collection. In the first class, the retrieval is based on the contents of an individual document, but the retrieval is based connections to other documents and not solely on the contents of an individual document.

The individual category breaks down into retrieval techniques that have a feature-based representation of query and documents and techniques that use a structured based representation. In a featured-based representation, queries and documents are represented as set of features, such as index items. Features can be weighted and can represent more complex entities in the text than single words. The structured based category is divided into representation based on logic, that is those in which the match of queries and documents is performed using algorithms that have a logical meaning and those that are represented by graph-like structures composed of nodes and edges connecting these nodes. Such graphs can be produced by methods such as using (e.g., semantics net and frame) or statistical techniques.

The feature-based category includes techniques based on formal model (including the vector space model, probabilistic ranking model, Hirazy et model, and Boolean model) and the techniques based on ad-hoc similarity measures.

## 3. DATA SPACE

As the volumes of data stored in databases increases within and across enterprises, there is a need to develop efficient and effective techniques of data management. With the increase in data volume, the amount of data accessible and the impact of data availability on the web as well as large databases, the impact has been that new opportunities for using data integration technologies have been created. A general view of Data space is shown in the Fig. 4. However, in spite of the large number of data integration opportunities, this technology seems to have had a limited impact in practice.

To a large extent, data integration mechanisms are manually coded and tightly bound to specific applications. The limited adoption of data integration technology is partly due to its cost-effectiveness [1]. The problem of data integration has been investigated for a relatively long period of time spanning from the early 1980s and it has been the subject of much research. The transparent access to data sets that reside in multiple data sources and are stored using heterogeneous representations. Data integration has many potential applications, e.g., it can be used for providing cross-querying of data stored in different databases, integration of data from multiple research labs or organizations, or to enhance collaboration in large scientific projects by providing investigators with a means for querying and combining results produced by multiple research labs [1].

More precisely, the specification of schema mappings (in such a way that, data structured under the source schemas is transformed into a form that is compatible with the target schema) is a fundamental step in data integration. Data integration systems have also been determined as a critical bottleneck to the large scale deployment of data integration systems [2]. Data space is a system that has been proposed to overcome this bottleneck [2], [3]. Data space has been proposed as the new technique of data integration [3], [4]. Data integration is an important research topic since it aims at providing transparent access to data that is stored in various data repositories that are often based on different underlying data models.

### 3.1 Why Data space?

Data space are clearly distinguished from traditional data integration techniques, because they focus on the data itself, rather than on the data integration. This was it is cheaper. More importantly, Data space on not require effort for semantic integration; they focus on data-existence instead.

Additionally, Data space provide higher degrees of scalability and reliability, and perceived nature of the entity relationship [3], [4], [5].

![Fig. 4 A View of Datospace](image_url)

## Examples

One example of a Datospace described as a personal Datospace is described by [3] as a personal Datospace in which users access data stored in a set of personal data repositories.

That set of repositories may include private file systems that currently exist on a user's desktop as well as private emails of a particular user. In the case of personal Datospace join like social networking communities, such as Facebook or Twitter, where users can share their understanding which items spread across their repositories/sources any related to each other in the same context. Although users are likely to search their data sources with keywords, they may also be interested in understanding relationships between data items. Users may typically desire to access the various versions of a certain file that exist in their Datospace, view files as well as emails worked on at the same time, or extract emails in the same project of a certain discussion.

A second example of a Datospace which is available as a public Datospace is one that can be created by users. It is larger data source, potentially covering a large, self-describing, semi-structured, heterogeneous database. Google Base certainly consists of a set of tuples with attribute values. Each tuple entry te is recorded in terms of a number of attributes with matching values. An illustration of a Datospace tuple is shown in Fig. 5.

```
Te(name: GalaxyPrime), (Color: black), (name: Samsung), (tel: 8756), (addr: Plotro 8,
Alwar, Raj.), (website: Samsung.com)
```

In this case, the tuple in the Datospace set can be considered as a tuple in an existing Datospace. In this second example, the data in the Datospace is continuously updated by users around the world.

## 4. HETEROGENEITY OF DATA SOURCES

In addition to the decentralization, the effectiveness of information retrieval is further worsened by the variety of heterogeneity present in the data sources. In each of these sources, data is organized using a different system operating systems, SQL, Vector Implementations etc., based on different conceptual models, and on different formats "system level heterogeneity" is considered in Be controversial much easier than before (e.g., via ODBC/JDBC connections to heterogeneous data sources). However, this is not the end of the road. "semantic heterogeneity", which appears every time there is a more than one way to structure a body of data. Semantic heterogeneity seems to be an unavoidable burden as data can be created in different ways, with different meanings, and with different data according to their own understanding of the reality. This of course is fundamentally different for each individual. In that sense, heterogeneity is to be found in data models, conceptual schemas, and of course the minds of the users. Page 26.

## 4.1 Solution

The basic principle of data integration is to combine different data sources into a single homogeneous Datospace by providing a way that a whole new data source is generated. The end-user, when querying for data, has the illusion of interacting with one single system, which presents him a unified logical view of the data available. The first attempts at addressing this problem were based on data warehousing technologies, which focus primarily on data warehousing technologies. Traditional solutions prescribe creation of new data source or information integration from heterogeneous data sources, which is not cost effective.

## 5. INFORMATION RETRIEVAL IN DATASPACE

Information retrieval (IR) is the task of representing, storing, organizing, and offering access to information items. IR is different from data retrieval, which is aimed at finding precise locations of information is not structured; it is the collection of heterogeneous data i.e. Data from any number of sources. Targeted data is usually measured in terms of the data collected and the model used to collect that data. World documents, Email messages, RSS feeds, Audio files, Video files, semi-structured (e.g. XML, LATINX, web data, Electronic Data Interchange(EDI), scientific data), or unstructured data (e.g. text documents, speech, image files, and sound files). Data sources are: relational data model in the form of relational databases (RDB), Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) data, collectively called Datospace.

## 5.2 Information Retrieval models for Datospace

The basic question in Datospace information retrieval is that How to find data of interest in within a collection of heterogeneous data?

The fundamental IR models can be classified into Boolean, vector, and probabilistic models ([6, 7, 10]). These IR models are used in information retrieval systems.

The most used data model in information retrieval are: the Vector Space Model(VSM) representing resources and queries as vectors in Datospace - the Probabilistic Ranking Model(PRP) using the notion resource peculiarity with respect to a specific query, and the Inference Network defined as an hybrid of VSM and PRP models.

### International Journal of Computer Applications (0975 - 8887)
**Volume 147 - No. 8, August 2016**

1) **Boolean model**: The Boolean model allows for the use of operators of Boolean algebra, AND, OR and NOT; for query formulation, but has one major disadvantage: a Boolean system is not able to rank the retrieved list of documents. In the Boolean model, a document is assigned weight as a direct key term occurrence. Overlapping and expected terms are not considered by AND, OR, or NOT/BUT. The retrieval function in this model treats a document as either relevant or irrelevant [7].

2) **Vector Space Model**: The vector space model can best be characterized by its attempt to rank documents by the similarity between the query and each document in the vector space. Similarity measures are used to rank the documents. In the Vector space model the cosine between two vectors is computed using the similarity cosine function. Similarity Cosine function can be defined as:

$$Sim(d_j, q) = \frac{d_j \cdot q}{|d_j||q|} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{m} w_{ij}w_{iq}}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{m} w_{ij}^2} \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{m} w_{iq}^2}}$$

Documents and queries are represented as vectors.

$$d_j = (w_{1j}, w_{2j}, ..., w_{tj})$$

$$q = (w_{1q}, w_{2q}, ..., w_{tq})$$

Vector Space Model have been introduce term weight scheme known as tf-idf weighting. These weights have a term frequency (tf) factor measuring the frequency of occurrence of a term in the document, and an inverse document frequency (idf) factor measuring the inverse of the number of documents that contain a query or document term [8].

3) **Probabilistic model**: The most important characteristic of the probabilistic model is its attempt to rank documents by their probability of relevance given a query. Documents and queries are represented as vectors in a document vector space. Each vector element indicating whether a document attribute or term occurs in the document or query, or not. Instead of probabilities, the probabilistic model uses odds (OR), where OR(1 = P(R|I)). P(R) is usual “document is relevant” and OR(0 = 1 - P(R)) “document is not relevant” [8].

### 5.3 Information Retrieval challenges for Dataspace

There exists several information retrieval techniques, however, none of them can be considered as the panacea for all Dataspace challenges. In order to generate the documents of the Dataspace and determine the appropriate data contained in the data sources, challenges faced by search engines, in Dataspace to retrieve the relevant data or information.

**Challenge 1**: One particular challenge is the huge scale, given by the huge number of WebPages available on the Internet (for example, about 30 billion WebPages were indexed by Google in 2005).

**Challenge 2**: Another challenge is inherent to any information retrieval system that deals with text data. The ambiguity of the language. For English, it is often difficult to have perfect matches between documents and user queries.

**Challenge 3**: Designing DSSs will involve significant extension of data management techniques, but it will be crucial to leverage techniques from several other fields.

**Challenge 4**: Several operations on Dataspace inherently involve some degree of uncertainty about the data, its relevance, correctness and completeness.

**Challenge 5**: Incorporating techniques from Information Retrieval will play a crucial role in building DSSP.

**Challenge 6**: Recent techniques from Information Visualization will be valuable.

### 6. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE

Due to the integrated nature and machine execution can be parallelized, techniques of Research Information System may not easy their conventional technologies like Relational Database management systems because exploration of domain knowledge is very crucial for CRS systems.

the sales launch week has come to a close and at this point you were either upset with pricing impressed by visual editing or super stoke the app router is finally in general release but I think there's a bigger picture that's being missed and that is that the cell is now positioning themselves as the front-end Cloud a place to go to get everything you need for your application without ever having to leave the cell's dashboard so first they launch storage using either KV postgres or even blobs those are now available through for sale some people were pretty upset with the pricing model that they were using and by the time you consider all the other factors that if you were to roll it on your own the Computing cost and everything else it probably works out pretty close at scale but the point here is now you have databases at resell so so far we have deployments we have a great framework we have easy integration paths for pretty much anything and now we have databases right in versa but now you have a marketing site and that marketing site needs some editing but you don't want to have to have a bunch of users going through say let's see Santa ecms logging in making the change not seeing what it looks like hitting save waiting for that app to build and then showing it on screen so they introduced something called visual editing which if you've been around on the channel for a while you know that I worked at Tennessee Ms who've been doing this for a number of years so bringing this mainstream allows users to be able to edit their content on the Fly and make it as easy as possible then firewalls have always been a thing that you need during things such as DDOS mitigation IP blocking and all things like that when you're on Enterprise grade and usually use something like cloudflare to kind of mitigate some of these problems but they introduced Versailles firewall which and then they introduced resell secure compute allowing you to have a private connection from your serverless function and right down to your vpcs or private infrastructure allowing you to then again remove another service that you may have been using in the past and keeping it all in resell but this isn't something new the cell has been slowly positioning themselves into this front-end cloud provider if you look at last year at facel's next conference they talked about things like analytics another thing that you go outside of resell to use so you either use Google analytics plausible or whatever your private provider is so if a sales saw that as an opportunity to keep another service in-house and produced for cell analytics which then went to General lease in April then they introduced resale cron jobs similar idea you always went outside of the service to use a cron whether you used an integration partner or you just had a way to fire off cron jobs via some sort of other means Roselle saw that as an opportunity to Corner that piece of them market and snap it up and resale monitoring that's another thing they introduced recently which I think was in March which was a way to visualize diagnose and optimize all of your sites all of these things are things that you've done outside of resale and slowly but surely they're bringing these in but sure some of those bills may be higher than others but having everything in a single centralized place that you can easily have all sorts of developers interact with without having the need for devops is what for a cell is trying to do the front-end cloud is here to stay and I think it's in a fantastic positioning for anybody in that market and the final couple of things that I think are super interesting is obviously the partner with nuxt that was released on Friday as part of Community Partnerships and of course clerk was also included in those for sale Partnerships as we move towards providing off for everyone so what are your thoughts on the front-end cloud is it a marketing scheme or is it actually good positioning for a company like for sale if you did enjoy this video and you made it all the way to the end here's another one enjoy it and of course if you're not subscribed click right here
